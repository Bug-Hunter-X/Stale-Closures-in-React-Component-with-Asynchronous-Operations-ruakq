# Stale Closures in React Component with Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in React components that involve asynchronous operations and state updates.  The bug is related to stale closures that can arise when the component re-renders while an asynchronous operation is in progress.

## Problem

The `MyComponent` component fetches data from an API.  However, due to the nature of asynchronous operations and how React handles re-renders, stale closures can lead to incorrect data being displayed in the UI.

## Solution

The solution uses the `useCallback` hook to memoize the `fetchData` function, preventing it from recreating on every re-render. This ensures that the closure used by the asynchronous operation remains consistent throughout the process, avoiding stale closure issues.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the project using `npm start`.
4. Observe the behavior of the component.
